That’s changing, though, as health outcomes research is moving towards technology that generates huge datasets (e.g., data from activity trackers that take hundreds of measurements per minute).\nAs I begin this course, I’m looking forward to gaining a better understanding of the data science perspective and to learning new skills that I will inevitably need."
